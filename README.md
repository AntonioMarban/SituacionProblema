# ecommerce-app

##### by Antonio Marbán Regalado & Diego García Galván @ Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM)

## Final project for the first semester *"Object-Oriented Programming"* course at ITESM

#### Asked to deliver a basic e-commerce app using C++ and the knowledge acquired along the course.

Our application works as an e-commerce app clone, run locally and printed out in the local terminal. 

The three classes (objects) that included in this project are:  
- Store (*Tienda.h*)
- Client (*Cliente.h*)
- Product (*Producto.h*)

Our main file, __Interfaz.cpp__ can be compiled to run the application. Once executed, the user is capable of:  
- Adding products to the store either via text input, or importing the products from a local file.
- Registering and adding clients to the store, giving them an empty shopping cart and saving them for future purposes.
- Adding products one by one to a client's shopping cart and completing the purchase, printing out a shopping receipt.
- Visualize the simulated daily income.
